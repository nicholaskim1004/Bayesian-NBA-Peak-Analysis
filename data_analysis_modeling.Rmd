## Data Analysis

```{r}
nba <- read.csv("/Users/nicholaskim/Documents/STAT 551/final proj/Data/peaks.csv")

nba <- nba[,-1]
```


Making plots to help with setting priors

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

tier_order <- numeric(nrow(nba))

for (i in 1:nrow(nba)){
  if (nba$Player.Tier[i] == "All Time Great"){
    tier_order[i] = 1
  }
  else if (nba$Player.Tier[i] == "MVP"){
    tier_order[i] = 2
  }
  else if (nba$Player.Tier[i] == "All-NBA"){
    tier_order[i] = 3
  }
  else if (nba$Player.Tier[i] == "All-Star"){
    tier_order[i] = 4
  }
  else if (nba$Player.Tier[i] == "Good Starter"){
    tier_order[i] = 5
  }
  else if (nba$Player.Tier[i] == "Role Player"){
    tier_order[i] = 6
  }
  else if (nba$Player.Tier[i] == "Replacement Level"){
    tier_order[i] = 7
  }
  else{
    tier_order[i] = 8
  }
}

nba$Tier_ord <- tier_order

ggplot(data = nba, aes(x = Country, fill = reorder(Player.Tier,Tier_ord))) + 
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) + 
  labs(title = "Proportional Distribution of Tiers by Country",
       x = "Country",
       y = "Proportion",
       fill = "Tiers")

```
US, Spain, Turkey, France, and Serbia have very similar distributions with an even spread of players across tiers. An interesting thing to notice is that you only really see top talent (all-nba and above) coming from the countries with top leagues in the world.

```{r}
table(nba$Country)
```
Let's look at differences in leagues within a handful of countries we have data for
```{r}
usa <- subset(nba, Country == "USA")
spain <- subset(nba, Country == "Spain")

ggplot(data = usa, aes(x = reorder(League,League.Diff), fill = reorder(Player.Tier,Tier_ord))) + 
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Proportional Distribution of Tiers by League in USA",
       x = "Leagues",
       y = "Proportion",
       fill = "Tiers")

print(table(usa$League))

ggplot(data = spain, aes(x = League, fill = reorder(Player.Tier,Tier_ord))) + 
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) + 
  labs(title = "Proportional Distribution of Tiers by League in Spain",
       x = "Leagues",
       y = "Proportion",
       fill = "Tiers")

print(table(spain$League))
```
For high school there is a selection bias in my data since the NBA stopped drafted high school players in the early 2000's and I pulled information on players who played up until 5 years ago. This means that those high school players who were significant contributors of had long successful careers where the ones that made it into my data while their other piers won't be captured.

In either case, the difference in leagues mostly seems to come in the number of all time great to all-nba talent that is produced.

```{r}
ggplot(data = nba, aes(x = reorder(League, League.Diff), fill = reorder(Player.Tier,Tier_ord))) + 
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Proportional Distribution of Tiers by League",
       x = "Leagues",
       y = "Proportion",
       fill = "Tiers")
```

Lastly, lets take a look at draft position and its effect
```{r}
ggplot(data = nba, aes(x = Round.Bin, fill = Player.Tier)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

ggplot(data = nba, aes(x = reorder(League, League.Diff), fill = Round.Bin)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

ggplot(data = usa, aes(x = reorder(League,League.Diff), fill = Round.Bin)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

ggplot(data = spain, aes(x = reorder(League,League.Diff), fill = Round.Bin)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

Similar, to the other plots, as we move further away from places where we'd expect top talent less is produced. If we were to disregard the selection bias in high school we can see in the us bar charts that as league difficulty gets weaker there are a high proportion of Undrafted players. This is more clear in the Spain example, where high school is filtered out.


```{r warning=FALSE}
ggplot(nba, aes(x = Draft.Pick, color = League)) +
  geom_density(linewidth = 1, alpha = 0.5) +
  theme_bw()  +     # hide legend if too big
  labs(title = "Draft Pick Density per League",
       x = "Draft Pick",
       y = "Density")

```
Key insights:
- League difficulty matters in terms of generating elite/generational talent
- Same goes for Round.Bin 

These variables should then have their own effect to capture should differences

Looking at Bust rates
```{r}
print(prop.table(table(nba$Round.Bin,nba$Met.Draft.Expt)))
print(table(nba$Round.Bin,nba$Met.Draft.Expt))
```

Age of players across Round

```{r}
nba %>% select(Round.Bin, Age.Enter) %>% group_by(Round.Bin) %>% 
  summarise(mean_age = mean(Age.Enter),
            med_age = median(Age.Enter))
nba %>% select(Round.Bin, League, Age.Enter) %>% group_by(League, Round.Bin) %>% 
  summarise(mean_age = mean(Age.Enter),
            med_age = median(Age.Enter))
```


Age of Peaks

```{r}
print(mean(nba$Age.Peaked))
print(median(nba$Age.Peaked))
print(quantile(nba$Age.Peaked,c(.25,.75)))
```

From the ages we can see that younger players with more potential are picked earlier and generally they reach their peaks in the prime ages of their career of 22-26.

## Data Modeling

Adjusting League.Diff to be a scalar
```{r}
league_raw <- (30 + 1 - nba$League.Diff)  # invert so higher = more difficult
league_diff_std <- scale(league_raw)[,1] 

nba$League_adj <- league_diff_std
```


```{r}
num_leagues <- length(unique(nba$League))
num_pick_bins <- length(unique(nba$Round.Bin))
num_tiers <- length(unique(nba$Player.Tier))

tier_counts_table <- as.numeric(table(nba$League,nba$Round.Bin,nba$Player.Tier))
tier_counts <- array(tier_counts_table,dim = c(num_leagues,num_pick_bins,num_tiers))

league_diff_map <- nba %>% select(League, League_adj) %>% group_by(League) %>% summarise(league_adj= mean(League_adj))

league_diff_map$difficulty <- c(17,24,13,9,1,8,20,30,23,22,29,14,10,21,25,3,16,15,6,28,7,27,18,4,19,26,5,2,12)

dat = list(L = num_leagues,
           P = num_pick_bins,
           T = num_tiers,
           tier_counts = tier_counts,
           league_diff_map = league_diff_map$league_adj)
```

```{r}
library(rstan)
peaks_mcmc <- stan(
    file = "peak_hie.stan",
    data = dat,
    seed = 1234,
    chains = 4,
    iter = 10000
)
```

```{r}
summary_df <- as.data.frame(summary(peaks_mcmc)$summary)
```

```{r}
pp <- rstan::extract(peaks_mcmc)$prob_tier_new

rep_counts <- array(0, dim = c(nrow(pp), num_leagues, num_pick_bins, num_tiers))

for (i in 1:nrow(pp)){
  for (l in 1:num_leagues){
    for (p in 1:num_pick_bins){
      rep_counts[i, l, p, ] <- rmultinom(
        n = 1,
        size = total_lp[l, p],
        prob = pp[i, l, p, ]
      )
    }
  }
}
```

Let's see how our models player tier proportions are distributed compared to the data 
```{r}
#actual all time great rate from data
actual_league_atg_prop <- as.numeric(table(nba$League, nba$Player.Tier)[,1])/sum(as.numeric(table(nba$League, nba$Player.Tier)[,1]))


league_atg_prop = numeric(num_leagues)

for (l in 1:num_leagues){
  league_atg_count = apply(rep_counts[,l,,1],1,sum)
  total_atg_count = apply(rep_counts[,,,1],1,sum)
  
  league_atg_prop[l] = mean(league_atg_count/total_atg_count, na.rm = TRUE)
}

cat("Actual\n")
print(actual_league_atg_prop)
cat("Sim\n")
print(league_atg_prop)
```

```{r}
actual_league_atg_prop <- as.numeric(table(nba$League, nba$Player.Tier)[,1])/rowSums(table(nba$League, nba$Player.Tier))

sim_league_atg_prop <- numeric(num_leagues)

for (l in 1:num_leagues){
  atg_count_post   <- apply(rep_counts[,l,,1], 1, sum)
  total_count_post <- apply(rep_counts[,l,,],   1, sum)
  sim_league_atg_prop[l] <- mean(atg_count_post / total_count_post)
}

library(tidyverse)

df_plot <- tibble(
  League = factor(1:num_leagues, labels = as.numeric(rownames(league_diff_map))),
  Actual = actual_league_atg_prop,
  Sim    = sim_league_atg_prop
) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(Actual, Sim),
               names_to = "Type", values_to = "Prop")

ggplot(df_plot, aes(x = League, y = Prop, fill = Type)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
  labs(title = "Actual vs Simulated ATG Rates by League",
       y = "All-Time-Great Rate",
       x = "League") +
  theme_minimal()

```

```{r}
actual_lp <- table(nba$League, nba$Round.Bin, nba$Player.Tier)[,,4]

sim_lp <- apply(rep_counts[,,,4], c(2,3), mean)
